**Research Interests:**
My research mainly focuses on applying and developing multivariate genomic methods to explore how modifiable risk factors for dementia lead to neurodegeneration and poor brain health later in life. I am particularly interested in modelling complex phenotypes, such as frailty and multimorbidity, to identify ways to prevent cognitive decline and maintain brain health through public health interventions or the development of pharmacological therapies.

I am also passionate about reducing inequalities in healthcare by conducting more inclusive research across diverse populations. I co-lead the Prevention working group of the Deep Dementia Phenotyping (DEMON) Network, an international network of researchers and industrial partners with a shared interest in applying data science and AI methods to dementia research.
